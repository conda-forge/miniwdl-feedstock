  summary: "A static analysis toolkit for the Workflow Description Language"
  description: >
    Miniwdl is a library for parsing WDL documents into a type-checked abstract
    syntax tree (AST), providing a foundation for new runtime systems, developer
    tooling, and language experimentation. It also includes command-line tools
    supporting the WDL development cycle, including a "linter" to statically
    analyze WDL documents for errors and oversights, and a Cromwell wrapper to
    make it more convenient to test a workflow locally.
